# Semana DevOps de Elite

This repository consists of my participation in the 'Semana DevOps de Elite'. The objective of the hands-on was to take a ready-made application and apply the DevOps concepts to the production environment.

During the event, the following topics were discussed:

-   **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**

-   **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)**
